# Overview of Crypto Currency Project
This project was to help us understand the K-means algorithm and principal componenet analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price flucations over time. I created a repository:  CryptoClustering and it includes both this readme file and the notebook Crypto_Clustering.ipynp. Data from crypto_market_data.csv was loaded into a DataFrame. The following steps were taken:
The first step was reviewing the data. Data was then prepared using StatdardScaler and scikit-learn.  
* The first step was reviewing the data.
* Then the Data was then prepared using StatdardScaler and scikit-learn. 
* The best value for k was found.
* Cruptocurrenices were clustered using K-Means.
* Clusters were optimized with PCA
* The best values for k were found uing the PCA Data
* Cruptocurrenices were clustered using PCA
* Weight of each feature was found
* Use Standard Codin Conventions and FOrmating


# Summary
This was a good step-by-step challenge to review all the different things we learned in Module 11. I did use ChatGPT to help me better understand the PCA variance, but did not use any help other than the previous week's assignments to complete this challenge.
